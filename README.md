# RegistrationSystem
This is a student registration system that i made while i was a computer science undergraduate.

As you can see there a few of them, all you need to do is start the server class then login class.
when you first get to the login page you login or register a account.
If you click register it will take you to the register page and from there it will ask you for relevent information.
As you see in the code i was using MySQL, and for this to work either you need to have that installed and set up on you OS, 
or change it all together it is straight forward regarless.
After the register and then you login you can go to the main page and from there you can edit your info and so on.
There is one feacture that if your a admin you can delete/add/edit and of the syudents info, i wasnted to add a log file for this, 
so after the admin does something it will be logged and the encrypted, but that is a feacture i will get around to implementing.
This is application uses "java swing" for the graphic interfaces.
I have a messageing system made for this aswell but i need to connect it to the GUI and give it a place to live.
